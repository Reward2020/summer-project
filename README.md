Project for Epam

For project I used next:

- App PetClinic
- Jenkins
- AWS
- Terraform
- Ansible
- Docker
- Git
- GitHub
- DockerHub

With the help of terraform, I created the infrastructure and configured access to it. 
Ansible, installed and prepared the tools with which he worked.
For Jenkins, I used the "Jenfile3" papline. I also used Dockerfile.

In Jenkins, I configured the connection to the nodes, added the necessary maven modules.
Configured trigger webhook in Jenkins and GitHub.
